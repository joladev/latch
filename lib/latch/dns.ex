  DNS transport boundary for atproto handle resolution.

  Wraps Erlang's `:inet_res` so this looks more Elixiry. Stubbed
  via Mimic in tests, this module has no unit tests of its own.

  Looks up TXT records for `name`, returning each record as a single string.

  A TXT record can arrive as multiple character-strings, they are concatenated
  per record. Returns an empty list when there are no records or the lookups
  fails, which callers treat as "no DNS answer".
